# ImbalancedMNISTData
#### Created a Convolutional Neural Network, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models to classify step and linear imbalanced handwritten digits from the MNIST image dataset to an accuracy of 99%.
#### To view the results of my models please refer to this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/megamp15/ImbalancedMNISTData/blob/master/Mahir_Pirmohammed_FinalProject.ipynb)
#### To read the report of my implementation and results please refer to the [Report](https://github.com/megamp15/ImbalancedMNISTData/blob/master/Report/Report.pdf)
